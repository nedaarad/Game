Snake game:

Snake is the common name for a video game concept where the player maneuvers a line that grows in length, with the line itself being a primary obstacle. In this game, the player's goal is to catch the maximum number of food without colliding the wall or itself. The player attempts to catch food by running into them with the head of the snake. Each food caught makes the snake longer, so avoiding collision with the snake becomes gradually more difficult. 
After running the program, you can play the game with your keyboard's up, down, left, and right buttons.
